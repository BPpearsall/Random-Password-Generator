# Random-Password-Generator

For our 3rd homework assignment we were tasked with creating a random password generator that would allow the user to use confirms and prompts in order to set the max length for the string and would allow the user to select 1 through 4 of the specified character types.

When the user needed a new and secure password, they are able to select the generate password button and a randomized string will appear in the correct text-box

When the user is presented with a series of prompts and confirm messages, they are able to select certain criteria they would like included into their password

If the user tries to select a password that is less than 8 characters and more than 128 characters. They are met with a prompt that informs them of only the valid password length and will restart the process of generating the password.

If the user tries to not include any of the 4 specified character types and hits cancel on each of the 4 prompts, they are met with an alert that informs them that they need to select at least one character type in order to generate a valid password. 

When the user generates the password, at least 1 of each of the selected character types will appear in the randomly generated password as to the users specifications. 

When the user generates the password, it will appear in the text-box which will allow them to copy and paste the password at will
